# GatherUp
Users can create a platform where they can discover and share/upload upcoming events, festivals, and parties with others.

GatherUp is a React app designed to facilitate event, festival, and party planning. It allows users to easily enter and upload details about their events, including dates, descriptions, and relevant information. With GatherUp, users can create a centralized platform where they can discover and share upcoming events with others. Whether it's a small gathering or a large-scale festival, GatherUp provides a user-friendly interface for event organizers and attendees to connect, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for all.

GatherUp will provide the following services:

1. Event Creation and Management: Users will be able to create and manage their own events, festivals, or parties within the app. They can enter details such as event name, date, time, location, description, and other relevant information.

2. Event Discovery: GatherUp will offer a platform for users to discover a wide range of events happening in their area or specific categories of interest. Users can browse through upcoming events, search for specific types of events, and filter based on location, date, or other criteria.

3. Event Upload and Sharing: Users can upload event-related content, including images, flyers, or other media, to enhance the event listings. This will help organizers promote their events effectively and provide attendees with a visual preview.

4. RSVP and Ticketing: GatherUp can include features for users to RSVP or purchase tickets for events directly through the app. This simplifies the registration process for attendees and provides organizers with an efficient way to manage event capacity and ticket sales.

5. Social Interaction and Engagement: The app can offer social features like event comments, ratings, and reviews. Users can engage with event organizers, ask questions, share their experiences, and provide feedback, fostering a sense of community and connection.

6. Notifications and Reminders: GatherUp can send users notifications and reminders about upcoming events they are interested in or have RSVPed to, ensuring they stay informed and don't miss out on any important updates.

By providing these services, GatherUp aims to streamline the event planning process, improve event discovery, and enhance the overall experience for both event organizers and attendees.
